# Razorpay Integration Guide

This document explains the Razorpay payment integration implemented in the TROMS subscription system.

## Overview

The subscription page now uses Razorpay for payment processing while maintaining compatibility with the existing Stripe backend API. This hybrid approach provides a better payment experience in the Indian market without requiring major backend changes.

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- Clean, modern payment UI
- Support for UPI, Cards, Net Banking & Wallets
- Payment summary display
- Real-time payment processing
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Payment verification
- Back button to return to plan selection
- Secure payment flow

### ðŸ”§ Payment Flow
1. User selects a subscription plan
2. User accepts terms and conditions
3. User clicks "Continue to Payment"
4. Payment summary is displayed
5. User clicks "Pay [Amount] - Subscribe Now"
6. Razorpay checkout modal opens
7. User completes payment
8. Payment is verified on backend
9. Success/error message is displayed

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files
- `app/(frontpage)/subscriptions/page.jsx` - Main subscription page with Razorpay integration
- `lib/razorpay.js` - Razorpay utility functions
- `lib/api.js` - Added Razorpay API endpoints
- `env.example` - Added Razorpay configuration

### New Dependencies
- `razorpay` - Razorpay SDK for Node.js

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id_here
```

### Backend Requirements
The implementation uses existing Stripe API endpoints with enhanced support for Razorpay payment data:

1. **Existing endpoint**: `POST /stripeWEB/purchase-subscription/{priceId}`
   - Now accepts both Stripe and Razorpay payment data
   - Razorpay Input: `{ paymentMethodId: "pm_razorpay_xxx", userInfoId, razorpayPaymentId, razorpayOrderId, razorpaySignature }`
   - Output: `{ success, message, data }`

2. **Existing endpoint**: `GET /stripeWEB/get-subscription-plans`
   - No changes required - continues to work as before

See `BACKEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed implementation instructions.
